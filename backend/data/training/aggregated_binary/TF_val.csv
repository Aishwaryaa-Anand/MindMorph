Always glad to help, and I'm glad that you enjoyed this conversation; I did as well. :) Good luck on your exams. Feel free to mention me in a post or message me if you have any more questions. I have not, but it doesn't sound like a pleasant time.    I'd imagine chronic anxiety could bring out the inferior function.    Yeah. Do be careful about developing your inferior, though;...

Yeah.    I'd believe it. You don't write like an F-dom.    Yeah. I guess at the very least, find ways to let go of things. Maybe throughout your day, as things come up that cause you worry,... My own philosophy professor once equated reading Nietzsche with falling in love, whatever that's worth to you.    I believe I saw that thread. I think it's pretty good description, but I think...

I definitely feel the need for validation myself, much for the same reasons you said, and my own inability to... It sounds like you're coming at this with the right heart. Too often people come to typology looking for validation.  As far as Ni differing based on the individual, definitely. I don't get those... No problem. Yeah, I think it is one of the failings of contemporary MBTI that it relegates the I/E distinction to the back seat; one's attitude is more incidental due to one's functional preference.... Jung places primary emphasis upon the attitudes, so at its heart, that's what that statement was getting at. More specifically, I was referring to its relevance to the whole psyche. Functions just... Ich. I hate it when that happens.    Yeah. And this is that pulp MBTI I was talking about. People want MBTI to explain why they like chocolate or something ridiculous like that. You're right... frigus  As an answer to the title of this thread, here's my question: can a butterfly look like a moth if viewed from far enough away?  I think the far enough away bit is probably the problem... Yeah. In general I know whether or not something is pleasing or displeasing to me. My emotions tend to be more represented to me through the weather. If I feel good, my mind seems sunny and bright to... Hello!  Would anyone mind changing my username to Anslem? (Spelled like that.)

This is probably obvious, but I was a little confused. Seeing evidence for both can be an indication that neither axis is dominant in your personality, and the fact that you're certain of your sensation would reinforce this (an ESxP or ISxJ will probably...

As a... Yeah, I think Ne can be a lot like Se in this respect, just interacting with the world and whatnot.    I would agree with this. I think this part of Ni is only really special from the outside... I agree that we tend to latch on to things. I just hesitate to call that Ni specifically because that's a quality of introversion in general, I think. My guess would be Se. Sensation either way, but like I said in my previous post, I don't think the attitude of the aux really matters terribly much. Part of the reason I realized I wasn't a lead 4 myself. I think just being feeling makes one more likely to be seen as 4.    Definitely. I joke sometimes that N actually means neurotic. Honestly,... Yeah, this also seems to reinforce the Fi.

It's like we think with our emotions and we need time to put it into words that others will understand and relate to.

I'm mixed about this one. I don't let just anyone use me like that, but I do tend to get pushed around by people that I don't want to upset. I think it's because I'm attempting to avoid any drama... I'm not sure why, but I've never been able to succeed at anything I do, even if I work at it for years. I feel like I'm always comparing myself to my sister though.

Nope. I'm an atheist, and I'm anti-organized religion. I personally believe that religious people are deluding themselves. And no, I don't feel like debating this.

I think it still applies to what you say you're looking for in post #5. The test for MBTI is highly flawed. Most people I know who take it are mistyped,... J and P are not functions. They are part of the MBTI nomenclature. There are only four functions: F, T, N, and S. There are eight function-attitudes: Fe, Te, Fi, Ti, Se, Ne, Si, and Ni. Each type...

Very interesting read, I really enjoyed reading everyone's ideas in this thread. I've got a lot of good stuff to think about.

It seems that lots of people forget that millennials are known for more than just tech such as optimism, idealism,  adventurous etc. No. The first full year of gen z is 1995 which is the HS class of 2013. 1993 and '94 are generally considered to be Millennials. Too bad you weren't here a few years ago. There were many people of... I didn't need to because I have seen that link a thousand times. Yeah, it says the typical start IS the mid-90s, but that does NOT that mean it's 1993 or '94. Again, either NO source or very few have... No 1995 is the beginning. Gen Z starts with the HS class of 2013. Sources even state that.  Hold Up! PPG wasn't popular anymore in 2004 and '05. Oh, and I take back when I said that show ended in... Well, that is because you're not reading enough sources. Most references have 1994/95 as the end, not much earlier than you believe.  Oh yes, they were. 1991 folks were children when PPG premiered,... No. What those comments are showing is that the Xennials are pretty much the older millennials, and are trying way too hard to fit with Gen X even if they wanted their own mini-generation. Besides,... This is an excellent rundown on each generation and its descriptions, and I like the chart. The only issue I have with it is the designations. I truly think it each cohort should have two groups of... This is an interesting perspective. I appreciate that you pointed those things out. I agree with what you said with on the last few points except for privacy.  About the consequences of words, that... Nope, not at all. I DO have male cousins though, and we all witnessed Power Rangers and Pokemon. Oh, and BTW both fads were for guys AND girls. What made you imply that Power Rangers and Pokemon were... I don't agree with that classification at all. All generations should be two groups. The whole early/core/late designations are frustrating and have made endless destructive debates in the past. ... So, she would have been in the minority then. The article stated that first-time moms were around 25/26. It would have been rare for people in her age range to have children during that time. Again,... I never said she was. All I said was that she is Gen X since it seems like she's in her early 40s. You said your mom is about 20 years older than you, and you're a 1993 person. That means she was... So for the last few days, I have been looking at comments regarding the Xennials (or the Oregon Trail Generation), and I have to honestly that they are pretty much older Millennials whether they... Do you even know what early 21st century means? It's not just 2000/01-09.  If your mom is about 20 older than you then she's not a Millennial. She would be Gen X. Again, yes some Xers had kids in...

I said it seems you don't remember when the internet was a luxury meaning that one was able to afford it before it was standard.  Not even!... True on that. Facebook was definitely much more popular and had already taken over MySpace by then, but I was just telling Jaderose that just because it declined in 2008 doesn't mean it was dead. It seems that you have no clue what luxury means. I'm saying it was a novelty before it became common to have the internet as it reached 50% in 2001.  That depends on the state. There are many... Yeah, you said that many times already, and I asked do you remember the internet when it was a luxury, not before it was common. You got the two confused.   Once again, MySpace was popular between... I didn't say they were not going to remember all of them. I said they were not going or recall some of them. Oh, and it's ok if you don't remember Columbine. Not all younger Millennials recall that... No, I'm not. I already told you I have friends and even family with that range. Once again, they're not going to generally remember all of those events due to their age when they all occurred. ... I think that would have still been rare though. I actually thought that those folks generally had Xers as parents, but I found out a while ago that was not true. I have friends and I know people who... I haven't said that 1977 was the cutoff for Gen X. The Generations forum already does that. Oh, and no, the 1982-2000 span has only been referenced from one source which was Strauss-Howe. Most so far... How was it stereotypical?     Yeah, you are. Just admit already. All the descriptions I have read don't agree with what you said. The most known cutoff for Gen Z is 1995, not much earlier than... When it comes to the hybrid childhoods I say that the 2001-04 people are all both even if they all lean one way or the other. They all would discuss the late 00s and early 10s just as much equally... I was just saying you're a conservative black person. you said it yourself sometime ago.  I know. I was just saying that most were in school when that event happened.   I'm starting to think that... Yeah, but it depends on what the discussion is about. Yeah, that's true that every generation has had criticism. I'm not going to deny that; however, the thing is it's going too far with the whole killing this killing that and some other BS. That's... Yeah, they mean the same generation. It's just that some people don't seem to know what a millennial is. Aside from sources using the 1982-2000 span, is there a reason why you think it should be that way? It's because 2000 doesn't seem to be common as much as it used to, and a little more than half of... You must have misread the link. It says signs stating how one is Gen Z and not a millennial.

Hey Amazing ENFJ's!!   I'm just curious.. what do you guys do to make you feel better or for happiness??? Cause i'm trying to find new ways to make myself feel.. important. :mellow: Ha ya.. i'm trying really hard to stay.. happy. :) it isn't that hard.. plus i have soccer tonight, so this should make me feel better with excirsising... and talking with people.  I mean yesterday... Truthfully.. i don't think i've done that before.. surprisingly!

I know i'm huge on organization.. like.. when the house is a mess.. i never really know waht to do with other peoples stuff.. but i try to just make it look nice.. i make it look neat.. and while i'm...

I need to stop being so down.. so i started to think of random things.. and tell me why you think they need that hehe... well.. he's super understanding.. and caring.. if i bring it up to him.. i know he'll try or want to fix it right away.. and probably doesn't even know it's bothering mee.. haha.. i just hate to hurt... well.. it's mainly over phone, chat, and txt he's like that.. not in person.. we both live in different towns..and i think communication is a huge thing in a relationship.. so is it cause he doesn't... That's exactly it! i feel so down.. i hate being downers for others.. and it really eats at me.. when i know someone cant help me.. or i don't know how to allow them.. and i know it feels horrible... :laughing: that's greatt! and i bet that made you feel wonderful!! i'm proud:) Truthfully.. i really don't fully understand the Ni yet.. because i just started this..  But.. i think with your assuming.. you are jumping to conclusions? i do this all the time.. maybe even... For your mom.. even though this is really not your responsibility.. but if it'll make you feel better, go for it. But for you mom... seems like she has a hard time trying to love herself.. point out... I agree. you have to go through gut feeling.. and who has told the truth more in the past.. Ya i know you are right.. and it's a horrible habit.. but it's the only way i can take things one step at a time kinda deal..  But oka.. lets say.. i have asked him why he isn't talkative.. and he... What do you mean by shadow behavior?  And that's pretty much it.. just it's getting too me.. i think i'll be oka.. :) thanks! the problem is.. i feel like i'm being blocked out from others.. otherwise i usually surround myself with tons of people.. Oka.. everytime i hit an object i say sorry too it.. like if i run into the wall.. i willsay sorry to it..  hmm.. when i get really happy i have this need to like scream and just be like WOOOHHH!... I'm an ENFJ and i dont think it's reading.. i observ.. and i understand why people do things and where they are coming from.. more then anything.  I'm good at knowing why someone does something..... ya... so i'm like.. if you are busy.. we can talk later? then he's like no no no! and then barely says anything?  but then some days he actually tries to add to the conversation.. and i'm sure he... When i meet new people.. i tend to be crazyy and woooh! to see how they react to me and actually try to make an effort to be my friend.. also.. i observe the person.. their actions, what they say and... Yes! this literally does drive me crazyy too.. Like with my friends or something.. if i'm going somewhere and i know i wont even have my phone for example with me.. i will tell them before hand so i... It does help me undersstandd... thanks :)  But i mean.. by emotionally.. is i don't like burdening people with my problems.. and i know he just wants to help... but i too.. like to suffer alone.....

I wasn't really offended, I just wanted to tell you that ENFJs really do commit, but I see that... I am an ENFJ, and my INFP boyfriend of a year and two months recently broke up with me. You sound a bit like him... But I want to tell you that while I see what you meant when you said that INFPs are... Thanks, I will try that for sure. I think it will help too. Unfortunately I don't live anywhere near a beach, but a bike ride is definitely doable. Also I should stop contacting him, right? He's too... I wish I had read this earlier. I did not realize that the inferior function is most likely responsible. I so want to help him, to let him know that I am here to talk. But I doubt he will talk to me... Well he has now given me that space. He broke up with me, because he felt that he was going to just hurt me worse than what was already happening. I understand yet I'm completely devastated. As... The inferior function... of course! He was and I guess still is under a huge amount of stress. But unfortunately.. He broke up with me. So there's not much I can do now. He is 17 by the way. Need help here, please reply to me!! As I mentioned before, my boyfriend is an INFP, and I made this thread about a year ago. I had noticed some changes in him. He was more distant, way less... So I did this because I have been confused on my personality type. I got ISTJ... So, ENFP? I was torn between ENFJ and ENFP, I just couldn't figure out which one I am more like. Does anyone know if... Well what you explained is exactly what I mean on this thread, nothing offensive or bias. My point in the thread is that maybe N types communicate better with each other and of course the same with... With all people or just certain ones is the question? Well, I can communicate well with anyone too. I'm talking about nonverbal communication, and how it seems that I do that best with fellow intuitive types. This is something that I have picked up on. I am an iNtutive type (either ENFP or ENFJ) and I feel that I communicate much better with other intuitive types. Does anyone else feel this way? With... I am lurking because INTJs are very interesting and intriguing to me. I have many friends who are INTJs, and I think they are cool. INTPs seem to really think a lot of ENFJs. On here, and in real life, at least the one I know of. They tend to think the INTP and ENFJ match is nearly perfect. Why is that... Yes, definitely agreed. It's always important not to assume those things. And our reasons are different sometimes and things that are a big deal to me aren't to him and vice versa. It's definitely... Losing people I love, not being able to help, no one listening to me.  I also fear drowning, i mean I can get into water, i can swim, but i do fear drowning pretty bad  Spiders, wasps. With... Ah, i see. INFJ is what she claims to be. She's a very confusing person i honestly have no clue. I love this thread. I just wanna throw out what's bothering me, I can't keep it in i can't i can't i can't!!!  First of all, I have 2 papers to write and I'm worried they're gonna be crappy and I... It's not your fault why are you sorry? are you ok? why does that matter? don't be so hard on yourself why can't you decide for once? I have 2 friends and they are an INFJ girl and an ESFP guy. The ESFP guy really likes her, and he basically worships the ground she walks on. I don't think she is interested, but it's hard to tell.... Ohh it's not that similar! I did not threaten press any sort of charges, and never said anything hateful to him, i actually cared about him and the whole experience was kind of hard for me. He backed... Oh I know! Reading about INFPs and ENFJs, I said the same thing. I need to get me an INFP. Then I had this friend take the test again (he had first scored at INTJ, because his answers were influenced... idk, up to you shutting up now I'm sorry i know this backpack has a hole in it, but i can't switch it for a different one because I'd feel bad for it oh, i can't because (insert terrible...

He... Yeah, my boyfriend is too, the guy i described up there :proud: Hello everyone~  I'm an ENFJ, and I know one INFP that I'm aware of, and we get along so well. We understand each other completely, and we could talk for hours and not get tired of each other.... Right now at this very minute... Say you will- Foreigner For my current boyfriend and I, this is our second time dating. The first time, we didn't know each other well enough on a deeper level, he was too shy to make the first move, and I felt awkward and... I have never met a confirmed ISTP :unsure: I want to someday, they seem cool! I wonder if we would get along. I tend to get along best with other NF types. Like my ENFJ friend and I can talk forever.... Yes, I think this is true!! I do that sometimes I think. I am VERY borderline j/p so that depends on who I'm around. Sometimes, if I'm around p's, I'll (not consciously) be more J, because I feel... There are stereotypical ENFJs though! But yes, i totally agree with you too about the energy thing :) I'm an ENFJ, and I would be pretty annoyed by that too. I don't think I do that. I think, from what I have read on here, ENFJ guys are different from ENFJ girls... Yeah, you would think an ENFJ would understand about flirting and stuff. I do get weirdly jealous when my boyfriend is alone with another girl. Only when they are alone though. Like if I'm there and... Yes, I am an ENFJ and I am also kind of shy.

Well I do get a sense of guilt that is terrible sometimes, but not to the point of really harming myself, that's just a little too far and very unhealthy... The guilt that i get is more, like if i... My guess- ENTJ. I mean, the executive? haha. He's seems more extroverted than introverted, and a lot of business leaders, entrepreneurs, etc. are ENTJs! Also, consider ENTP...'",1,F

I sincerely hope everything works out well :D Hi hello, just an ENFP browsing through and I just wanted to say, I LOVE INTP'S :D    That's all :) I originally thought of the party popper things, but the FOOD POPPER THINGS ARE SOO GOOOOOD MMMMM :love-struck: *stares back with a mouth full of pizza and a happy grin* *acts like she understands what's going on*  ...   *still confused as hell* I'm sorry, but I'm new to this and honestly, I'm very confused...  what's going on...? My best friend is an INFP and I love you guys!!! Well, I love every type but I love you guys a lot!! THANK YOU FOR EXISTING!!! One of my best friends is an INFJ and she's so much fun!!!!! YAY!!!!!  I woke up this morning feeling great and after stumbling back over this thread, I feel so happy my face hurts from smiling so much :D Some of my favorites are the Mandela Effect, MK Ultra, JFK, and of course, Bigfoot.  Actually, any kind of spooky creature thing. I love 'em! :D This is the cutest thread ever holy shit   I hope it worked out :D I hate pretty much everything about ENFP's on tumblr because almost all of them portray ENFP's as:  OMG I LOVE BUTTERFLIES SO MUCH IM GONNA CRY!!11!111!!!111 OOOOO SOMETHING SHINY!!!1!!1!!! LOL SO... I know one INTJ, he's pretty weird, but funny. We play video games with my cousin, ISTP, and my best friend, INFP. It's an odd combination, but we have fun :D  I wish I knew more INTJ's my age... Hi!! ENFP here! I was wondering what other types think about conspiracy theories! Feel free to talk about them below, I LOVE  theorizing about stuff :D Pros: I like how creative ENFP's are, and how generally friendly we are :D  Cons: I struggle a LOT with anxiety and fears of not being good enough, that everyone actually hates me they just don't... The things I do the most are probably: I prioritize others' happiness over mine. I feel like I am personally responsible for everyones happiness, and if anyone is sad, I feel like I failed. You know... Awesome! His N was the one I was the least sure about so it's good to hear that you agree! I got an ENFP vibe when I first watched his videos, and I was curious if it was right. After binge-watching... OOOORRR Pewdiepie as ESTP. The only ESTP I Know is unhealthy so....that may not be right haha Jacksepticeye: ENFP. He fits almost every characteristic of an ENFP, I don't really see him as anything else tbh CrazyRussianHacker: ISTP Markiplier: INFP. Madeyewlook: ENFP Glam&Gore: ESFP or... I personally think: Jacksepticeye is an ENFP (He just fits it so well, and since ENFP's are known for being energetic, positive and loud, I'd say its a safe bet ;) Markiplier: I see as an INFP.... I actually don't know any ESFP's, so that one will be hard for me to figure out.  I know a couple people have put him down as a J but, Luckily, ENFPs know how to relax, and they are perfectly... Hello fellow ENFP's! I was wondering what you all thought Jacksepticeye's MBTI was. I keep seeing stuff saying he is an ENFP, and I honestly can see it so well, but I can't tell if it's just wishful... YES! Let's get this to happen! Can I bake lots of sweet things for it?:welcoming:'",1,F

My take is that she likes you, but doesn't know how. She's trying not to think about it as a romantic relationship. I won't dare to say that she sees you only as a friend, specially if she's INTP.... That type of ignore happens to male and female alike, I think he was pointing at ignoring deliberately. This kind of makes me intrigued. What do you INTP girls say regarding that?  Let's say...... Yes, atm it's becoming too emotional and too uptight. You're defining a gossiper, not gossip.  I don't understand why you keep talking about it.

Either way, you're regarding it as an INTP + INTP, which... If it wasn't on a professional context you'd feel stressed? Why? It's not like the discussion is with you.

By all means tell her that you loved to ear her thoughts. This is how INTPs connect, she stopped sharing those because she probably felt you weren't contributing to them, that she was boring... Is that a Yes? Have you witnessed it or are you speaking as a psychological point of view? So you are saying ISTJs have the same needs as the INTP? Lol. Sorry, I found it amusing, care to develop that?    So basically you said: a perfect pair (amongst themselves) can be perfectly... Exactly! We can decompose their arguments and amuse ourselves seeing them putting them back together justifying each of them while striving to win. And we can also get extra variables to confuse them... Lol, well, not humouring them, more like humouring myself ;P (but, ya its not as funny as decomposing INTJs). But it was cool because unknowingly they quoted me and actually gave me reason. Ok.

Gilly thanks:) Thats the thing you see, especially when your ex is a freaking ISTP who.. is successful in repressing feelings and avoidance. It makes you feel like you're the only one in this... I... TheTechMan haha sorry, well I started a thread about my situation but long story short: timing and circumstances and being in different locations. I cry buckets when I am misunderstood, angry, depressed, or just anticipatory grief even. I agree with you, I think he might be more selfish than the personality thing resulting in his decisions.

I agree, people telling me that everyone goes through this, move on, you deserve better and stuff. But in actual fact, I say I am an unhealthy ENFJ, because I really lose all hope and feel that... Wonder how you are with your SO?  I was in a LDR FOR 1.5Years with my ISTP ex BF... We never met and (I'm also from Singapore) LOL. He broke up with me cos well circumstances and I think he thinks... Are you guys still together? ENFJ and ISTP pairing? I agree with you. It was extremely difficult throughout my relationship which ended with him leaving... but I felt like we both learnt a lot. Sadly it wasn't enough pwowq when they do think of people, would they focus more on the good or the bad? Would this thinking ever translate into regret/feeling of loss or OMG I want her back? Now, I might not know much to give as much insight, but from what I see of your post,  1. I'm sorry you were so badly hurt. Having someone you love/loved tell you that he couldn't have a connection... Okay... I am sorry I offended you lol. Wasn't stereotyping him but this is a forum for personalities, so... Haha well, I think it was unlikely hormones or excitement considering we were in a relationship for 1.5 years.    I thought about it, but he thinks I still do not understand. Maybe because of my... 1418, Yes I agree with you.  I don't need an immediate answer, but it would be nice to not read my message unless he can reply.. or at least say he's busy.

I also apologised for not being... ENFJ feeling extremely worthless and suicidal and finds no meaning in life now post breakup with my ISTP ex-bf:( Ah oh man, really? Any advice is appreciated though, or thoughts! cursive 1418 Yes you are right, he has unblocked me since the end of February after he imposed a 2 weeks no contact post breakup.

Do ISTPs not initiate conversation?  1418 Thank you:) cursive     Oh I am serious actually... you mean the bolded part? Because you asked I thought you had some advice to give! I got a bit confused at what you were trying to get at oops. But this was definitely not my fault the breakup. I wish it was, like I wished I had betrayed or cheated on him so I wouldn't feel so... I think I agree with the loud music example. But then no offence, my example of taking responsibility if you murdered someone, would be to make up for it, and not to just stop murdering?. Hmm,... I am a super unhealthy ENFJ post breakup right now. I feel hurt, scarred, betrayed, used, disgusted at myself and how human beings can be so selfish, angry, upset.  I blame myself for being naive... that is so horrible. Guys who cheat deserve nothing. Sometimes I wish my ex bf had cheated on me. It would have made it so much easier to move on than some stupid selfish reason like I want to work... You are! But I get super riled up hearing responses from ISTP users... :x    So what do you mean by emotional support? Oh wait, I also forgot to mention one really sweet thing he did... We have... I have been through heartbreaks before, it's nowhere like this. It feels like I am betrayed, abused, hurt, taken for granted, used...    you know I wish sometimes he was a complete jerk, that he... Maybe it's how different we are, it's ridiculous to me. I did nothing wrong and how dare he let his feelings fade, or string me along whatever if he never wanted to meet me. It's honestly ridiculous... haha sorry that I didn't seem to understand. So basically you're saying he appreciates me as a person, yet doesn't want me in his life?    okay I guess I was at fault... He blocked me on whatsapp... is it possible if you could teach me ways to go about that? Honestly, I really hate being a ENFJ, after this incident, I desperately want to be like you guys. ISTP.

Baby me... Sadly this isn't me at all. The more I read on the ISFJ forum the less I feel like a ISFJ. I can't relate to any of it. I go between INTP, INFP and ISFJ regularly. I crossed out Fi and I appear dominant Si, so ISFJ is what I've gone for even though I don't relate at all. I also get branded as the most boring type.

Probably the same differences as between ENTP and INTP men... Does your logic get in the way of your ideas/creativity (INTP) or do your ideas/creativity get in the way of your logic (ENTP).

We can't feel good about a decision unless we feel like we've taken an objective... I saw some INTJs mention their dislike of Ti on a different thread. Is that a common thing for INTJs to dislike? If you dislike it, why is that? I'm not bothered by it, because I can be pretty clumsy too. But I don't want to help.

The ones who we do trust will get our full trust. It is just the issue of who we let in the pack. :P I don't know. I assume modern times since you brought it up while I suggested you stay here to admire the subforum colour. xD It makes sense, but now it raises another question.

Well, the thing is that yes, I did originally think he was an extrovert... Yep, I'm still around (albeit very infrequently...)  And I've changed my mind. Peter is definitely dominant Fi, so INFP.  What do you think? Slacker? How much is the salary? In whichever case, I'm not getting paid enough. Yes, of course.

It's easy to mistype INFPs a lot, either with ENFPs, ISFPs, or INTPs as you said. I assume if an INFP is not comfortable showing their feelings that's when confusion starts I don't think MBTI is very good in predicting relationships, just because each MBTI type is different.

ISFPs and ESFJs. ISFPs have Ni as their third function, while ESFJs have it as their third, so there could be quite a bit of confusion! Yeah unfortunately that's the number one thing I think of when I hear ESTP, but I know not all you guys are like that   I think ENFPs have a really good reputation so I'm not really embarrassed Se stare can be quite hot I think too. Idk it just has that sexiness to it, that can be hard for other types to replicate. I mainly have that notorious Russian blank stare that seems to scare a lot... Yes, no doubt about it.

I'm a Jewish ENFP, but Im culturally Jewish as opposed to religiously.

I'm not really sure where the SJ traditionalist stereotype comes from, to be honest.  Maybe Kiersey only looked at elderly SJs?  Oh and don't get me started on Te being about organization.

While the lead function tells you alot, being an extrovert/introvert should be fairly obvious. Hmm interesting. I am kind of offended easily but I am trying to not stay mad at people and find a reason they acted the way they do. I mean, I come from a Christian-baptist background so I have some... 20 years old. I wouldn't say anything mean behind someone's back, I have said something poking fun at people but nothing too harmful. Ok?   I have strong beliefs I generally don't like going against but at the same time, if I see something i believe as illogical I may doubt it at times.  I believe this is Fi. I used to think I...

Ah good point, I live in a tiny town in north carolina. Pretty boring place to live for the most part. I'm sorry, I meant is Ne dominant personalities rare? ENFP/ENTP? Ok is Ne rare or something?
