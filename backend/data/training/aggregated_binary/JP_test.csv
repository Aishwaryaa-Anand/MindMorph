The words Artisan (SPs), Guardian (SJs), Idealist (NFs) and Rational (NTs) are translations of Plato's types from 340 B.C. This was written by David Keirsey:  Myers's E-I scale is badly flawed because she inherited Jung's error of confusing extraversion with observation (S) and introversion with introspection (N) This has actually been really hard for me to work out. When I take tests that measure my preferred functions, Fi and Ni are always equally my dominant ones. It seems that it's only because my Ne is... I think Keirsey's idea was that these pairings are the most 'useful' to each other.  For example, the ENTJ can give clear direction to an INFP's 'cause'.  I'd imagine (and kind of hope) that the...

Myers wrote in a preface to 'Gifts Differing' that her mother (Briggs) was INFJ, and that she used her introverted intuition as insight into the meaning of type. I don't know about Jung, but Isabel Myers was INFP and Katharine Briggs was INFJ (according to Myers herself) I understand everything you've said apart from this:    If you imagine someone without any intuition at all (obviously no people like this exist, but just to help explain).  'Theory' would be a... You're right, I didn't take that into account.  But I think TreeBob implied that sensing can be used in a discussion of theory, so I'd like to know how this is possible. I don't see how sensing can be used in a discussion of theory.  Surely a sensing type still has to use intuition to even know what a theory is?    I agree with this, but I meant that sensing... I don't think it is really possible for us to type you from reading a forum like this.  MBTI is a theory, so it is a 'N subject'.

It needs to be worked out what exactly the different theories are measuring, because they can't all be measuring the same thing. I feel that would be best left to someone...

I posted about this here, and it made me doubt MBTI theory -Until I read Myers' Gifts Differing, which explains that Jung's descriptions ignored the auxilliary functions. I still have doubts though... But couldn't an Ni type come up with something amazing as well by using unconnected bits of information?  Sometimes I get so confused by how the functions work, especially how they work with each... I've read this too, and I think it's something all INFPs should read.

I agree with all of these comments because I can relate to them myself.  I think my reason for asking was because I was expecting him to have an interest for these same reasons, and was surprised... Earlier today I was explaining MBTI theory to an INTJ (I got him to take the test a while ago but he has never known about the actual theory). He seemed very interested at first, but after some time... Yeah that's a good point.  So the 'evil' doesn't lie within humans themselves, but in what they have created -modern society.  Even though it was created with good intentions. I often think about this too -it seems like a common INFP thing to feel like you are the protagonist in the story of life. Of course the chances are we never will change the world on a grand scale,...'",1,P

I pay to you all my respects to have found the will to completely expose yourself, you've done a really good job. Honestly, I'm...

I hear a lot about how it's hard to get an ENFJ into a relationship. Can someone explain this to me? Is it because you have high standards and don't click with people easily? Or you want everything?... Hi Maisie7,  I've dealt with this with the ENFJ I'm interested in. He seems to just be really nervous about screwing things up. I've just taken things slow, shown that I'm interested, and let him... Thanks again.   He somehow didn't get my text. He responded immediately the next day when I texted again. He seems a little busy and I am too so right now it's not a big deal. We're keeping in... Is it? I don't understand. Does it take a while for y'all to commit? I mean, once I know I'm all in. I've known for about 11 months. I called him on Wednesday and told him I was moving for sure and... Thanks, HGy.   I've known him for a year. We've been talking often. He just seemed to rush into talks about me moving there and asking me questions on how I see marriage and whatever.   We're not... So, I'm currently seeing an ENFJ. He's been overseas for half of the year and is due back soon. I'm curious, what is necessary for an ENFJ to commit? We haven't seen each other in a little over 6... I think a lot of times we sit here on this forum and think we know how people think. I'm guilty of this too. We think we know someone's morals through some sort of description someone else gives and... Absolutely. Thank you for that. I completely agree. Fortunately, I keep busy enough that I don't think of him always. Hopefully I'll talk to him when he gets home next week. ....seriously? He lives 1000 miles away from me. That's not the kind of person he is. I know that it's not. Wow. Now you're just projecting.   Thank you everyone. I'll deal with this. I don't know. Taking me home to meet his family and asking me to move to another state after telling me he doesn't do long distance relationships seems pretty telling to me. Not to mention making... Okay. I'm at this point thoroughly convinced he is very very interested in me. BUT, it's just not good timing which is why he constantly checks in on me and asks for updates and tells me his plans. ... Oh for fuck's sake. Any ENFJ want to confirm this?  It sounds pretty spot on. In which case, I absolutely will freak out on him. I'm thisclose to just losing it. I feel like he's using me as a... No i javent told him yet. But, can I be that direct? The last time I told him what I thought about him he responded surprised but then didn't contact me for a week.   It's like he forgets about me... I'm having a problem with an ENFJ who I am interested in.   He pursued me and has shown interest in me for about 6 months now. Yet, I see him playing hot and cold. He perceives my straight forward... Oy vey. What the hell does that mean? When am I moving?? What's with the winky?    I guess my question is this to all the ENFJs who have helped with this thus far: what's with the hot and cold? am... So what reason would there be to ask for an update?  He asked when I was moving. Again. Then told me to let him know how it goes.   Also, he had phone problems and I offered to help him 1. figure... Okay. So when you guys go let me know how it goes and want to keep up to date with someone, what does this REALLY mean??  Do you care a lot about that person that you'd want them to update you? So at what point do you decide that is time to tell someone how you feel about them? Are you ever comfortable about it? Are you guys not very in tune with your feelings? I thought this cognitive function was the dominate one. I guess it's hard to explain over the internet.   He has been keeping up with me over 3 months asking me when I'm moving to another state (we're in different states). Over those 3 months we kept up... :/   What do I do now?  Also, he just flew to another country on Thursday. He didn't text me all week and didn't tell me anything about leaving. I knew his plans to leave. I did not know he was... Do you ever get intimidated out of pursuing a relationship? What happens if someone else expresses feelings to you about you? Is avoidance a normal reaction? So I told this ENFJ that he was my favorite person. Then after he asked why 10 seconds later I said You listen well though I talk a lot. And give good advice. I think you're funny. A little dorky.... I know you guy probably have a very close small circle of friends but, if you're seeing someone or like someone a lot, do you talk about them at all? Like share thoughts or anything? Who do you... He seems completely clueless about girls liking him. And he is pretty caring. I'm in a situation with this guy who keeps asking me to have an affair and he's pretty upset with it. Texting in caps... ENTJs, i've noticed that i have this tendency to share a bunch of information with people about my day or situations that are going on in my life. I do this to make people feel connected to me or... Sounds like he's interested in being friends and maybe starting something but then changes his mind. And that's what you may be picking up. Yeah. So far it's like calling myself and talking for hours. I feel like I can already trust him and we don't really have any quiet pauses. We think the same things about people and can make each...

He said he's not thinking too much about it because he doesn't need to do anything for about 9... I can tell the difference between an ENFP and ENFJ. He's absolutely without a doubt an ENFJ. Super obsessively clean, extremely organized, very perceptive of others feelings to the point that he'll... He's worth it. I've never had so much peace about someone. I know we'll get married. I just wish he was better at communicating. And more logical. This is all about it feel like going and I'm like... I think you need to re-read everything I've typed on the last couple of pages. Obsessed and needy is the last thing I want from him. He was like that at the beginning and it freaked me out a bit. All... I don't feel like he's jerking me around. I feel like he doesn't know how to have his cake and eat it too. Unfortunately it's in both situations. What he's gagging is that I'm going to just hang... The ENFJ I know did this a couple of weeks ago. He stopped talking to me. Granted he's in another state but I know ENFJs pretty well. I'm surrounded by them. I just knew he needed to work it out. So... I get that. He's not the center of my world nor will he ever be. And vis versa. But, it's never good to have a relationship inside your head. No matter what. He'll leave for 7 months. I may or may... Anyone else besides KC on here have an opinion? Thank you KC but it's nice to have a variety.  The ENFJ I'm interested in mentioned marriage, raising kids, future plans the first time we hung out.... Do you share important life events or your feelings with anyone? How open are you? We had plans before we met. I've encouraged him to stick to them. If he wants to travel I think he should. I ended up quitting my job and he is going to quit his also. He lives in city A and I'm... Our conversations are like this: what's going on? Oh I'm glad those are your plans. These are mine.   Our future plans match.   I'll see you when you move here. It'll be good to have you in town.... Yeah, I'm wondering how to identify between friendly and an enfj liking get you.   At what point would someone know that an enfj is interested more? So I posted something on social media on Monday about how sometimes the timing has to be just right for things to happen and he texted me right away asking what was going on. I told him I'd tell him... I know it's not too late. He just never told me what he wanted.   Is the liking my posts stuff just to let me know he's still around or interested??  I'm not exactly sure what to do next.'",0,J

I'm the same. People tend to think I'm weird; and if I try to act normal people can tell I'm putting it on. I understand what you're saying, but we need sensitivity too. It helps us empathise with people. Unless that's not what the question is referring to, in that case ignore me:P  As for my answers: ... I tend to like anyone introverted. Probably because I am such a huge introvert and feel I could relate better.  To be honest an introvert chasing introverts could be the reason I haven't had much...

Well if you spend more time with him you'll know he at least enjoys your company. He won't put time into something that he doesn't think is worth it. She could always wait too.

I hope I'm not off here. INFPs seem to be from what I've read and noticed. Are you clingy? Do you get very attacked to someone? For example, I know 2 INFPs who are unable to get over their exes for a long time now. kazoz I'm not really surprised, ENFPs are more people-oriented.

Yeah, it's not that far-off from reality. But as you might agree, a much more fool-proof method is to know people in real life rather than looking at candid photos of them. Photos are one-dimensional... haha, not all socionists believe in the validity of VI. You need to get good at it. It's not so much the structure of the face and body as it is the body and face language of the person. I know a... If you are unwilling to distinguish between valid theory and crackpot claims, fine. But don't try to bad-mouth something you are afraid to look into. These descriptions are russian bullshit, end of story. Socionics is not MBTI, so don't expect a MBTI type description. How a socionics type description works is how through the blocks of functions... Socionics is a vastly superior system to MBTI bro, and I would disregard all this INTj have rounded shoulders nonsense immediately. This is not how socionics works. Check out Wikisocion for what...

Yeah, I feel for you. Find a new girl man, one who won't treat you like a bitch. Party slut girls are gross. I like your type of woman better. Don't come to me, I will come to you if I like you. Simple as that. You are compensating for your heartbreak man, watch out. I would be wary if I were you man, but it's your life. You are crushing hard, and I myself am subconsciously compensating for my girl haha.... Yeah, I treat everyone with respect, which is rare in our society today.   That is a really cool story man. I really liked it. Yes, in a sense, I am indeed unique. Even regarding the other ISFP I know, I don't feel they know the Real me at all. This is all I can say that is otherworldly.

The idea is, you don't want someone emotional since you yourself is emotional, but you want someone who can open up to you. Congrats, ISFP have that ability.

"'I think so. ISTJs are known as the introverts who are most in tune with society's values that, they can pass for extroverts if they wanted to (for a short amount of time of course).

Do you just fake a cheesy grin, or do you find people... 1. I don't think you can really force an ISTJ into any activities. He must have already noticed what you're doing since we're so observant, so getting his attention will not be a problem. He just... I often ponder about what life contains as I'm so intrapersonal, but not so much about the bigger picture, that's more occasional. I can be controlling but I'm also quite perceptive. If I do want my relationship to do well and see they want me to back off then I'll attempt to I'm 16 and took the test last year, I've only got interested in it this year, I couldn't believe there were so many systems and ways to learn about people. It's vital stuff. I'm quite logical and self-controlled, most of the time I don't see how fighting will actually help my situation, so there's no need. Plus, I see acting out in anger as an inability to handle people... Types of one sort aren't always huddled up on one area. You could just live life and encounter places with a lot of variety in people, and at least one might be an ISTJ. If you go looking in places... I never related to the 'superdependable' stereotype, or being the most organized, traditional or simply put 'boring' type at all. However as I get older, my life's structure is becoming more and more...

I'm not too into... :confused: I do not relate to this thread :unsure: Sensors aren't any less smart are they? ISTJs are supposed to be intellectual.. Yeah, people always interpret it as utter negativity Yeah, I'm worrying about a particular detail that could go wrong in a period of 40mins, three days from now, so it's not wrong :) Can be veery reclusive and moody. I think the laziness thing as some truth, they're not ones to do favours and risk wasting energy. I would say, a little private and not apt to sharing. These are... I'm 70% introverted and all 9 ennegram types active in me are sexual variants besides 3. I'm extremely aware and concerned about how people perceive me and how my relationships are going. Although... I wouldn't be too fond of the person after that and I'll definitely let them know in the same way they let me know, that they are not liked.  Maybe you should reconsider you're approach to people?... I didn't want to sound like there's nothing good about us and that we would have to think and search seriously hard to find one. I wanted to avoid negativity and let other ISTJs know that we do have... What puts us 'out there' in the world, what advantages do you feel you have... in other words, why are we so awesome? Why FP? I know she's a J because she's a real planner and 'get's mad when people alter plans at the last minuite'. But F rather than T? Perhaps because she stuck to her values through her career? But... Perhaps sevens would be playful enough to really give them a good time. Fours could be emotional enough or twos?  What are your thoughts. Being an ISTJ I score really low on neurosis which is strange a female, and seriously bugs my ENTJ friend who thinks I'm immune to everything. However, true I'm never 'relaxed' as there's always... Yeah, if they know too much they might use it against me later.  I think we're more cautious than most in social situations due to our introverted ways. When things go wrong, extroverts can mend it... I have to say, at times I'm not so spirited about being an ISTJ - every description we have just tell us we're boring, serious, traditionalists. :confused: :frustrating: I mean, there are interesting...

I like a variety to suit different moods, but I really don't like popular music.Don't know if this is strange for 'A Guardian'. I love artists that are more experimental and... Social and sexual variants tend to be more concerned with relationships than anything, esp with the type 3 which is meant to be 'The Achiever' the so/sx types will only pay special attention to work... I think it's really the self-pres variants that care for achievements 4's for being too arty and not realising it, 5's for having their own intellectual interests and seeing school as too conventional and demanding? Counter-phobic sixes just wanting to be rebels :wink:... If tritypes are enneagram types that always occur one in each Enneagram Centre then we don't need them; as we all have all enneagrams in us at different levels. 8's because we do what we want when we want and generally don't care; believing ourselves to be the masters of our fate. The good thing is we won't blame anyone else for our circumstances.     ... Then you may have a few different enneatypes. Everyone has a trifix I suppose i'm a 3-8-5.

I'm not a tag along sort of person and definitely am happiest when I can organise my outings. I do not seek social contact a lot as it's not necessary but when I feel like it would be a good idea... I've read somewhere : ISTJs select friends carefully, being keen observers of things and people around them. It may be that they a familiarising themselves with you- we're not extroverted so we... Don't know what kind of music you may be into but the lyrics to this describe that state pretty well 'Nine Inch Nails-All the love in the world'. And I can relate-not being extremely close to anyone.... Myself, lol ISTJ. How boring I think I should do it again lool.. I guess the situation would be easiest when your with someone like you.. I also discuss philosophy, may not be something natural, just learnt it because I took the lesson in school. However, it's always me who brings the logical, scientific arguments to the debate lol. Hugs are the new handshakes, especially for the younger generations. I have always hugged people -because its what you do in social situations.

Winnie the Pooh's Hefelump movie and Happy Feet. Yep. I'm weird. The Hunger Games too, but that was because I was a huge fan of the books and I had been waiting for the movie for years!

And I was wondering if there were any Gleeks out there who wanted to discuss the show. My OTP is Klaine if anyone wants to talk about that too! :happy: The Hunger Games. Without a doubt.

Deal fully with something before moving on to the next so you don't have to go back to it again-if that makes sense! ENTJs are pretty ruthless-we'd probably have no qualms with killing some zombies! Thanks! :proud: Why not! Gosh, y'all are spoiling me :blushed: No, thankYOU! I was a little surprised when I read some of the stereotypical qualities of an ENTJ, as, although I relate very strongly to it, I knew I wasn't a monster!!'",0,J

Oh yeah I can appreciate that as well, but sometimes it's nice not to lay one's head on a concrete block all the time and enjoy the seemingly weightless pillowy softness of abstraction. I don't find socializing despicable, just stupid people despicable. Or being told that all people belong in boxes. Now that's a yawn for me. I told some people this weekend that I don't like people, while I was hanging out with people.   (sips tea) Oh, I have to agree here. Even my husband is sometimes surprised by my emotional fervor.

I get super attached to my friends too, and I feel this need for them to be equally attached. When I don't feel like they are, insecurities pop up. Well, until now I thought I was a 1w9.

My hunch is that a lot of us lurk.. ;) Yes, I have a few letters that have negative emotions because they remind me of dissolved friendships, but at the same time I can't bear to throw them out! You know you're an ISFJ when your INTJ brother drives you up the wall by saying you said something which you know you did not say. You press the subject because you do not remember saying it,... SO TRUE! And then once you've given them the gift, you worry about whether or not they really like it. All of these. Wow. Lol I thought I was the only one who kept every handwritten letter/card/note of any kind! If I was forced into it then I'd go willingly -ENFJ friend I'm an ISFJ and I'm a Christian. I think this question has more to do with how someone is raised than their personality type, though. I'm not an ENFJ but I've noticed this about my ENFJ friend. He can't be single. I feel like it's because he can't put up with the loneliness. Huh, never thought about it this way but this is definitely true of my ISTP brother. Him and I were never really close until we shared a hobby (swing dancing), and I've noticed that he only makes... My ISFJ brother is eerily similar to me. I think he might be a different enneagram type though. Yep! I have a penpal. We don't write as frequently anymore since we started college, but we're still in touch, after about 8 years! I'm not 100% sure he's ISFJ because I only know him as a lab partner, but he seems a lot like me from what I do know. He uses the word feel a lot rather than think even in cases where think would...

(ISFJ here) This made me laugh because it is SO like my ISTP brother! Personally, I find INTJ's thoughts and ideas to be quite fascinating when they choose to share them and are willing to continue communicating until I get it. [/I][/I]By strong, I meant well-developed. Is it correct to speak in those terms? For instance, would it be right to say I'm an ISFJ with a well-developed T? Do you become the center of attention because you rarely speak, so when you do, everyone listens? Because I've noticed this to be true for me. And it then reinforces my non-speaking behavior because...

So what is your holland code and what specific ways has it helped you? Thanks again. Thanks for the response. I definitely thought it was one of the better assessments out there. I also scored AIS or the Strong Interest Inventory scored me as ASE. What work have you found yourself in? Hi, Here are my two cents. I think you could be an ENFP. I remember reading that the extraverted intuition function loves novelty and is directed at the outside world. You are 17 and already... So do you think this is true of the other types as well?

You're right about the point that the meaning of ENTP is directly associated with the function stack (I personally don't like the word stack here, it's too 1-dimensional).  I don't disagree...

Try to read IDontThinkSo's signature link, it's up the page. I think it might help you understand more about the variety within ENTP (regarding the use of Ti/Fi).

I even gave up at one point because i though it wasnt working. Maybe it did a little but i know now... She never asked for my help. she never would. She crys about it once and a while but I see it just getting worse and I don't want her getting any worse than she is now.

How would you view/place judgement on a person after just finding out that their social life is lacking, meaning, they have no, or perhaps just one friend. Would it matter?  What about in a... I did say something along these lines. Not the same, but something like Look, I'm really bad at figuring this kind of stuff out, so if you are upset with me about something, you have to tell me or... I did! Multiple times. Three times to be exact. After that, I realized he wasn't going to talk. He simply dismissed my question. Nothing is wrong. Even though something obviously was. I definitely didn't dismiss him. His feelings are important to me, whether or not I agree with them. I apologized, genuinely. But in my head, I did feel like He went through all of that, for that?.... Yes, because I pissed him off on purpose, and plan on repeatedly pissing him off just for my own jollies. I didn't say or do anything to intentionally piss him off. Like I said I was unaware that I even did. It was trivial and silly for him to be that angry. And I didn't deserve the silent treatment when... Thank you so much! Your post has been very helpful. I hope you don't mind if I ask you a few questions. I've numbered some things you've said to reference my questions to!  1.) In this situation, I... My boyfriend (INTJ) and I have gotten into one of our first spats, sort of. Basically, he became angry at me because of something I said, but instead of being angry at me, he just sort of got pissy... Just boyfriend! No hubby! But, I've always felt this way. Long before I met him! I've noticed this huge gap in type myself, the T/F difference is one of the ones that most definitely stands out to me the most in people. It is difficult for me to get along with most F's myself, so... I actually love dressing up and having a job that requires me to do so. I act professional, it seems to be my default personality, sometimes even in leisurely settings, so the workplace feels like... Wow, that was really negative!  I'm sorry you've had such bad experiences with SJ's. I can assure you, we are not all simple, bitchy, and air headed! Sure! I'd love to. I'm currently dating an INTJ, so my answers might be a little biased toward them instead of NT's in general.   1.) What annoyed you most about any NT'S you've known? Perhaps... The response I've seen from the NT community regarding SJ's has seemed to gear towards the negative. My boyfriend is an INTJ, and he seems to adore me. Just wanted to narrow the general feeling down... Oh, yes! Definite yes to both of those things, heh. I have a few close friends, and while I do enjoy their company, I also find maintaining the friendship to be exhausting for me. My ideal friend would hang out maybe once or twice a month, and keep...

"up  someone has an idea on his type ? mbti, enneagram, anything ? https://www.youtube.com/user/strengthcamp/playlists    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzvZd-Um6mQ&list=PL8-D9KeyZL84c33s23JbATeOeafEDeTfA&index=1 Ted Bundy had a lot of potential, and he screwed it all up just to kill some people. The guy is the stereotype of the nihilist that doensn't see a sense in his life. It seems to me like serial killers value SO MUCH the fact of killing people that they ignore their life (risks, money, time, ...) for that. Doesn't seem like a Judging trait, to say the least. Yes I know that. But you missed my point again. I can have reasons know, mmm let's say realllllly big reasons to kill that neighbor (totally made up) that I hate and all. But then am I gonna do it ?... I think you nailed it my friend. Nope, I don't think enjoying something is enough to do it. I'll say it another way. Two possibilities in life : you're poor, then you have to work more to get money.... So everybody who is different that the mass has a personality disorder ? It's funny how depending on the context, the notion of personality disorder changes. A dictator can be seen (avoided the... Yes, I may take myself into account when I talk about that since I'm supposed to be the same type. But still, I can think objectively and detach from myself when thinking in general. And yes, I think... I know a lot about human psychology (no pretention here), everybody does to some extent. I shouldn't have to prove myself, I've read a lot of articles on a bunch of different subjects in psychology... It's funny that you attack my behaviour when worse can be said of yours. No offense, just sayin' Yes indeed, maybe they can become efficient at killing people for the sake of killing, but in my (sane ^^) mind, such work is useless. You waste a lot, you risk a lot, and what do you earn in return... How could it make their life easier ? I'd say it would be the contrary. But I get what you mean. Exactly ! That's exactly what I was trying to say ! It's so unefficient and unhealthy to spend so much time and energy just for the sake of killing a person without motive. It's really... Yeah I understand, not all ENTJs are the same regardless of enneagram, and especially if you add enneagram and/or other systems. Indeed, they will display a lot of differences, maybe making some... I'm sorry I've disturbed your Ti sharpness is such small details Yeah, ESTP is possible too. Of course any type can kill, as long as you have a knife or whatever and hands, you can. BUT. Children mostly don't kill. There almost have never been any INFP dictator.... ffs, you seem to turn around my point on purpose. I already agreed that ENTJs can be serial killers (like Patrick Bateman indeed). That's not what I want to say. I think a J would need a much... Yes, yes ... but I mean even if you enjoy it ... it's like a waste a time IMO, there are so many things more important to do, why waste time in planning and stalking a person for weeks just to kill... Yeah I know that, but if I may, you missed my point. Of course any MBTI type can become a serial killer. But it's about proportion. I know a lot about serial killers and it's precisely why I ask this... It seems to me like the serial killing is more a Ti-Fe thing, and requires a bit unstability, hence P, ExTP seem to be the most represented among serial killers (Ted Bundy was probably ENTP).  Do... I don't think we can take her MBTI tests results into consideration, since we all know how mileading online tests can be, especially paradoxically when we actually don't know the the theroy behind... Yeah, forget what I said, she's ESTP, just watched a few more videos She doesn't have so much Fi values. There was a video where she was reading mean comments (and some of them were really hurtful, I felt bad for her) and she took it quite good. I think an Fi user... I'm totally fine Prada =) you're right, maybe these combinations do exist. Prada Ok you win, I'm tired of that debate, maybe you're right at the end of the day. Yeah .. idk. Enneagram is about motivation more than behaviour imo otherwise you'd make the same mistyping as what you said about them when they don't resemble anything stereotypical.  And when you... You may be right about her being ISFP. The thing is, I don't see her as impulsive as ISxPs are (generally speaking). For example there's Nika Volek in the show, that someone typed as ISFP, whose Se... There were also ENTJ 4s, 9s and 2s if we have seen the same stats by the past. Does ENTJ 4 make sense to you ? What would it look like ? I'd like to see how Te can focus on practicality when it's in... That's why I said mainly :p I know you guys ENTJ 1s exist but the majority must be 8s I think. 1 is more an STJ type to me, because the values of 1ness are too restrictive, which contradicts the... By definition, ENTJ has Te > Ni and Se > Fi. Anyone who claims to be ENTJ and doens't respond to this is not ENTJ. By definition, INTJ has Ni > Te and Fi > Se. Anyone who claims to be INTJ and... Haha xD yes I agree, it's a natural tendency for me to classify. I've seen ISFP, ISFJ, INFP and INFJ for her (all the IxFx) so I think it's not easy to type her. We have to consider her damaged life.... Michael : INTJ who has too many emotions, so he looks like an F sometimes Lincoln : ISTP Sara : ISFJ, I mean, she's a nurse, I think she's almost the same type (including enneagram) as the blonde... He looks like Patrick Bateman, which is ENTJ 3. In some way, he looks like me too, but not really (I'm an 8, quite different, I relate to people in some way, I have narcissistic moments, but they... You can't already restrain it to a letter or a function, it would be biased, we need all data first before implying that it's linked to this or that Make it simple : 3 polls in the same thread (if that's possible ? I never tried it) : MBTI, Enneagram and D&D alignment, then someone (or many) would correlate results and share their views  EDIT :... I lean towards True Neutral, and I'm ENTJ 8w7 sp/sx. Someone mentioned a poll, I think it's a great idea. I thought for a very long time I was INFJ, until I understood that functionally, I am an ENTJ. Hey people,  What do you think this guy is :    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqYS_7Pov0s  I wanted to put a spoiler tag but I don't know how to, or maybe it's not possible. Anyway, my guess...

Fear of manipulation, loss of control of our emotions, rationality being overwhelmed, that you will take what you want, and leave a mess when you're done.  We must trust that you can see the... I've told her that.  She knows how I feel without me saying it.  She can read me in a way that's scary.   All this is making my head spin.  I'm just going to float for a while and see where I end... Bonds can be rebuilt.  Perhaps it's important to analyze relationships and obligations in terms of need.  What do I need?  What is holding me back from figuring out what I want?  I don't think it's... Ok, so this is all the same stuff that's frustrating me.    I look at things realistically.  If a relationship status is defined, what changes?  We spend more time together?  We already spend as... Absolutely not.  But you're right in a way.  If she's always telling me what she wants and needs, how does she know what I'm giving is truly coming from me?    A part of me wants to tell her that... It's not hard looking back after it's done.  But it's hard understanding what she needs to hear from me, and what I have to say.  She never told me what she needed.  We were both upset, and in trying... It wasn't really hard, because it was something I ultimately wanted to do.  It only seems difficult in the mind because we have the perception of vulnerability.  We lay something on the table and... You need to make your wants and needs known to him.  If he cares, then he will do what he can to accommodate these.    If he continues to seem like he doesn't care about your wants and needs, then... ENTp is the infantile, ISFp is the caretaker.

Take care of yourself.  Improve... I think she loves and cares about you.  That's likely why she bought you gifts. But in no way does that mean either of you are good for each other in a relationship.    A healthy relationship can... That could be true.   However, I would think that other's perception of us is likely much more objective than our own perception of ourselves.  Like if you were to watch a video of yourself, you...

Likeness eventually gets boring.   But it's useful as well.  Relating and being understood effortlessly.  Speaking the same language.  Connecting to similar people with different life experience.

I swear even if I told someone every detail about my life they would still claim that I'm 'hard to read'. You don't have to hate conflict to be an ISFP - I don't hate it and I'm one. So I'm pretty certain Harry Potter is an ISFP! Some more: Lana Lang - Smallville Maxxie - Skins Puss in Boots - Shrek... Well you're a bit of a douchebag aren't you. The point of this thread is to get everyone's individual opinion on which types you PERSONALLY think are the most sensitive/insensitive, again I'm not... I just meant as in which feeler you think is generally least sensitive towards other people, and which thinker might be the most sensitive towards others. It's a broad question because I'd like to... Just curious here, and I swear I am not trying to offend you in any way at all, but are you talking about one or a couple of ENFJs that you may have had bad experiences with, or ENFJs as a whole? But seeing as ENFJs are Fe users, wouldn't that mean the opposite? It generally would be the unhealthy Fi users that would only care about themselves wouldn't it? Aw, poor guy. I'm the only ISFP in a family full of ENTJs and ESTJs. I feel for him haha. I wouldn't say 'obviously' - those sites often get the celebrity types wrong. How likely is this combination? One of my friends is most definitely an INTJ, but he got 9 on the enneagram test (can't remember the wing) and it just seemed quite peculiar to me because I'm pretty... All good, I like reading peoples opinions anyway :) What do you think the types of The Wizard of Oz characters would be? I'm a 4w5, close to being a 6. Not sure on the wing. I have a very, very love hate relationship with most of them. I'm really close friends with four INTJs, one of which is my best friend, and one of which I had an extremely complicated relationship... How about be a good friend and put up with it - he's obviously going through some shit and just because you don't like listening, doesn't mean you shouldn't. However, if it gets out of hand, just be... I think an unhealthy one can be yeah, they might be very selfish with their choices, or they might have some really twisted morals that might lead them to do pretty bad things, although probably with... Usually things that I find funny. Sometimes shit that I'm feeling at the time but a few of my friends lurk my tumblr a lot so I have to limit those ones!

I've always thought that Johnny Depp was beautiful - especially in the 80s. Dear INTJ, You're not always right. No, really, you're not. I know, it's shocking. But strangely enough, very true. Sincerely, ISFP. Dear INTJ, You're not always right. No, really, you're not. I know, it's shocking. But strangely enough, very true. Sincerely, ISFP.  PS. I was not aware this was an ISTP thread. I'll see... Jennifer Lawrence, Johnny Depp (I think it's more his attitude towards most things that I like about him, rather than his personality though), Emma Stone, and quite shamefully Zac Efron. Don't judge.... Definitely a Senser (from what you've said), I would say a thinker most likely, so overall my best guess is ESTJ. Not sure on the Judging function though.
